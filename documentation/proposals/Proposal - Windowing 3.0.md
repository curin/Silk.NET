# Design Decisions
- This proposal assumes no knowledge of any previous iterations of Silk.NET Windowing.
- This is a complete rethink of Silk.NET Windowing built from the ground up to account for our goal of "write once run everywhere" for .NET 6 and Silk.NET 3.0.
- In this proposal, there are three parties:
   - **User**: the person using the Silk.NET Windowing library and by extension a platform implementation.
   - **Platform Implementor**: the party providing an implementation of the Silk.NET Windowing abstractions (abstractions such as the "Surface" as defined later in this proposal). This implementation will be referred to herein as the **Platform Implementation** (or the **Platform** for short)
   - **Library Implementor**: the party providing the plubming around the surface abstraction (such as the platform selection mechanisms and accompanying source generators). This will be referred to herein as the **Library Implementation** (or the **Library** for short)


# Platforms

There will be a number of "reference" implementations for the APIs laid out in this proposal. These are:
- For `net6.0` and `net6.0-windows`: GLFW.
- For `net6.0-ios`, `net6.0-tvos` and `net6.0-maccatalyst`: UIKit. (NB: The latter two will be a target for Silk.NET 3.X) 
- For `net6.0-macos`: AppKit (NB: This will be a target for Silk.NET 3.X, it is recommended developers targeting macOS use the regular `net6.0` TFM)
- For `net6.0-android`: EGL and ANativeWindow.
- For `net6.0-tizen`: TZSH. (NB: This will be a target for Silk.NET 3.X)

The decision has been made to drop SDL due to complications and the fact that all non-desktop targets are distinctly unique in their own right. We believe that in creating platform-specific code for each of these will result in significantly more robust support for each of these platforms. 

- **QUESTION:** Should we drop our SDL bindings too?
- **MAINTAINERS' ANSWER:** Yes, it's no longer used by us and a library such as SDL is a large amount of maintenance weight to carry. Akin to us dropping EGL in the 1.X-2.0 transition, we will be dropping our SDL answer.

All of the above is informative text, however, and no reference implementations are required or guaranteed to use these APIs under-the-hood.

Unlike previous iterations, one reference implementation **MUST** be bundled with the main Silk.NET.Windowing assembly. Given that we can easily use platform-specific TFMs there's no reason to keep the fragmentation of different implentations across different assemblies.

The reference implementation will be accessed through the static `Surface` class.
- `IsPlatformSupported` **MAY** return false if there is no reference implementation available for the given environment.
- `GetOrCreate` **MUST NOT** return `null`. It **MUST** always return a valid `ISurface` if `IsPlatformSupported` is true and no exceptions or errors ocurred during surface creation. This method **MUST** always return the same `ISurface` instance.
- `CreateNew` **MUST NOT** return the same `ISurface` object, and **MUST NOT** return `null`. It **MUST** always return a valid `ISurface` if `IsPlatformSupported` is true and no exceptions or errors ocurred during surface creation.
- `ClearCurrentContexts` **MUST** call `ClearCurrent` on all `IGLSurface` or `IGlesSurface` instances this reference implementation has created. 

For the reader's benefit, this `Surface` class isn't really intended for general consumption though it must be public for those applications don't fit into the model defined in the "Windowing Entry Points" section.

# Surface

In this proposal, a plane upon which graphics can be rendered on is represented by an `ISurface`. `ISurface` defines a minimal subset of basic APIs which **MUST** all be present on an **Platform Implementation**. The idea is `ISurface` just provides the bare necessities for rendering a game or application without knowing too much about the form factor, better encouraging cross-platform/"write once run everywhere" code. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

`ISurface` **Platform Implementations** **SHOULD** also implement any extension interfaces that it can support for a given platform. Through these extension interfaces, if user code needs to access APIs which are more specific to certain form factors or platforms, they should use casts to get a more specific surface.

The "core `ISurface` API" is as minimalistic as possible to allow easy use in integrations into UI frameworks or other environments. For example, at some point in the future we'd like to make `ISurface` implementations atop WPF, MAUI, Avalonia, and more; as well as atop Blazor WASM (and by extension HTML5 and WebGL)

# Windowing Entry Points

Even with the platform selection mechanism, there is a lot of plumbing required to get to the stage of acquiring a surface on the various platforms. In Silk.NET 3.0, the **Library** **MAY** decide to expose a Roslyn source generator (the "**Gluer**" as used herein) to assist with this. If it doesn't, this section and its requirements can be discarded.

The **Gluer** **MUST** be distributed in package/namespace `Silk.NET.Windowing.Roslyn`.

The Gluer operates on **User** methods that:
- **MUST** be static
- **MUST** return `void`
- **MUST** have a single parameter of type `ISurface` or a type that inherits from `ISurface`. If the latter, the Glue **MUST** assert that the `ISurface` created is assignable to the parameter type or throw an exception if this is not the case. This allows applications to use `IDesktopSurface` only if that's their jam.
- **MUST** have the attribute `SilkEntryPoint`

The idea is the Gluer will generate `Main` methods on .NET, `Activity`s on .NET for Android, etc... The **Gluer**, if generating **MUST** generate the necessary APIs to ensure that the method in question is called on application start-up (the "Glue"). If any of the above User requirements aren't met, the **Gluer** **MUST NOT** generate Glue. If a method is found with the `SilkEntryPoint` attribute but fails to meet one of the other requirements, the **Gluer** **MUST** generate a compiler error; otherwise it **MUST NOT** impact the compilation whatsoever.

If multiple methods are found with `SilkEntryPoint`, the **Gluer** **MUST** generate a compiler error. All attributes **MUST** only be name matched by the **Gluer**.

The Gluer **MUST NOT** modify the original type (i.e. all Glue must be defined in its own self-contained type)

The **User** **MUST NOT** define their own application entry point (such as a static `Main` method in the case of regular .NET) if they are using the Gluer, though the Gluer does not have to enforce this.

The method **MAY** be called multiple times throughout the lifetime of an application. This is because of operating system restrictions - the only way to definitively know whether this method is being called for the last time is the `IsTerminating` property or `Terminating` event on `ISurface`.

The Glue is purposely left undefined as this is operating system &amp; platform specific, and would not reflect any future platforms we decide to add.

A model example of what this looks like:
```cs
public class MyGame
{
    [SilkEntryPoint]
    public static void RunGame(ISurface surface)
    {
        // do things with your surface
        surface.Run();
    }
}
```

# Optional Features
## Desktop Surface

A more rich set of APIs intended for use on desktop-style window management systems. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

## OpenGL Surface

Enables OpenGL context creation atop a native surface. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

## OpenGLES Surface

Enables OpenGLES context creation atop a native surface. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

## Vulkan Surface

Enables Vulkan surface creation atop a native surface. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

## OpenGL Surface with Framebuffer Transparency

Framebuffer transparency is an optional feature, and therefore has its own interface. This allows the a window to be created where the content area is transparent. For a description of what this entials, see the defined API and the documentation comments therein.

NB: We've been discussing `IWebGLSurface` a lot recently, but this is left out of this proposal as this is a target for Silk.NET 3.X.

# Proposed API
- Here you do some code blocks, this is the heart and soul of the proposal. DON'T DO ANY IMPLEMENTATIONS! Just declarations.

## Delegates

NB: instead of generic delegates like we've used in previous iterations, we use named delegates instead so the parameter names are auto-filled out by IDEs with indicative names, instead of `obj` or `argN`.

```cs
public delegate void Vector2DAction(Vector2D<int> newValue);
public delegate void DeltaAction(double deltaTime);
public delegate void WindowStateAction(WindowState newState);
public delegate void FilePathsAction(string[] filePaths);
public delegate void ToggleAction(bool newValue);
```

## `IWindowHandlesSource`

Pretty much as is from 2.X's `INativeWindowSource` except using the new struct.

```cs
namespace Silk.NET.Core
{
    public interface IWindowHandlesSource
    {
        WindowHandles Native { get; }
    }
}
```

## `WindowHandles`

Replaces 2.X's `INativeWindow`

```cs
namespace Silk.NET.Core
{
    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Auto)]
    public struct WindowHandles
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The Silk.NET team wishes to reserve the right to add any relevant window handles that arise when implementing the reference implementation as nullable fields in this struct.

The goal is to keep this type lightweight as it is in Silk.NET.Core (to ensure smooth interoperability between Silk.NET packages without creating hard references), hence why interfaces or type-system-driven approached were not used.

# Meeting Notes

## 25/02/2022

[Video](https://youtu.be/dac3t0oh3VU?t=1984)

- Approved.
- Questions around windows handles
    - What Win32 handles should be available?
        - Mostly what we have for 2.X today, but as a struct
    - StructLayout = Auto for WindowHandles so that people can't depend on the memory layout (so we can add more handles!)
- Is glue mandatory?
    - Nope, you can use GetOrCreate but SilkEntryPoint will be recommended.
